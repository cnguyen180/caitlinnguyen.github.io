### Strategizing for Spotify: Enhancing Playlist Placement Opportunities 
**Code:** [`Strategizing for Spotify: Enhancing Playlist Placement Opportunities.R`](https://github.com/cnguyen180/CaitlinN-data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/NewMusicFriday.R)

**Goal:** To provide evidence-based strategies to increase the likelihood of artists' songs being featured on Spotify's "New Music Friday" playlist.

**Description:** Examines the factors influencing song placements on Spotify's "New Music Friday" playlist, offering strategic insights and recommendations for artists and music labels to enhance their visibility and streaming performance on Spotify.

**Skills:** data analysis, statistical reasoning, strategic thinking, presentation proficiency, visual data representation, and project management

**Technology:** R

**Results:** Show that artists with higher solo streaming numbers and those experiencing a surge in daily streams are more likely to have their songs featured on Spotify's "New Music Friday." This suggests a focus on building a strong solo streaming presence and leveraging current streaming success are key strategies for playlist inclusion.

### Financial Profiles: A Study of Mortgage Solvency
**Code:** [`Financial Profiles: A Study of Mortgage Solvency`](https://github.com/cnguyen180/CaitlinN-data-analysis-portfolio/blob/main/Mortage.R)

**Goal:** The main objectives are to predict mortgage defaults using a decision tree algorithm and to estimate client income using lasso and ridge regression models. This will aid in understanding the key factors contributing to defaults and the variance in client incomes.

**Description:** Utilize a dataset of 34,000 active mortgages to identify the reasons behind loan defaults and predict total income for clients. The analysis will involve training classification and regression models, assessing their performance, and interpreting the results to provide actionable insights.

**Skills:** Data preprocessing, model training, validation, decision trees, lasso regression, ridge regression, data structure visualization, performance metric analysis (confusion matrices, RMSE).

**Technology:** R
